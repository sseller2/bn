There are multiple ways to do this. To accomplish what you are asking you need a `301 redirect` that would go within the `.htaccess` config file in the root directory of the new Magento site (assuming the current server is run off Apache). About 80% of servers are Apache but note that this solution is different if the server is a Microsoft IIS based system, CentOS based, etc.

Google's Answer:
    
    http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=93633

You would redirect your old URL to your new one to prevent search engine links becoming broken and thus avoid all pages losing their SEO reputation.

**.htaccess 301 redirect**

An example redirect:

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.brick-anew\.com$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.magento.brick-anew.com [R=301,L]

That example would redirect all `www.brick-anew.com` requests to `www.magento.brick-anew.com`. In this way your link in the exploded menu could be to the new URL or to the old URL since one is being forwarded to the other. Be sure to use relative rather than absolute paths for all links, image sources and external code sources, like JavaScript files.

Finally, be sure to hide `index.php` in the url using these redirects. The `index.php` portion of the URL is negative because it serves no purpose in describing the link, making it unnecessarily complicated and more likely to be truncated in search results. 

Showing any `.php` filenames in this way allows an attacker to more readily profile a target for vulnerabilities and ways to break past site security. Because I know just from the URL that the site uses PHP, I automatically know that it may be vulnerable to SQL injection or XSS scripting attacks. A file extension of `.php` is also debated in SEO circles because it is an immediate red flag that a site is being served from a database, thus more likely to be spam.

I'm not yet familiar with the layout but what you are describing sounds like a poor solution to achieve what you are trying to accomplish. If you comment code out but leave the associated containing element, such as a surrounding div, then that code still has to be parsed and acted upon by the browser. 

Although nothing comes through on the front end, browser overhead is being created to read through comments, which in turn slows the site speed. No comments should ever be displayed on a live production site, all should be stripped via a build file to ensure any code commenting is restricted to your development environment.

Instead of commenting code out and if it is impossible to have the items removed before deployment, the containing element should be removed from the DOM completely to avoid the browser being forced to act, as described above.

Remove div w/ id "myDiv" using jQuery, after DOM ready:
    
    $(function(){
    	$('#myDiv').remove();
    });

Same as above as far as not using comments. I would have to inspect the way orders are being authenticated but you are probably looking at some moderate PHP work to allow this behavior if it is not included as a standard feature.

I would first investigate why Magento is making this re-write and attempt to ditch it if at all possible. Next I would try escaping my slashes when inputting them using the standard `\` character for escaping:

    \/shop\/fireplace-glass-doors\/page1.html

**Encoding File Paths**

Although escaping in this way may work, it is considered best practice to encode the path to prevent different interpretations of the path between different browsers. 

This can be accomplished via JavaScript's `encodeURI()` function:

    %2Fshop%2Ffireplace-glass-doors%2Fpage1.html

You would then enter that as your Category URL Key and the browser will decode it automatically and treat it as a normal link.

**JavaScript/CSS/HTML File Minification**

Let me start by saying that you shouldn't have been editing the `style.uncompressed.css` file because the Magento framework is going to be calling the minified/compressed version at `style.css`. Uncompressed/unminified files are for use in the development environment only, then are minified and deployed live. If your fix HAD been in one of those files, you would have first made the change in `style.uncompressed.css` because it is spaced and formatted to be readable by a human. The formatting, however, isn't necessary for a computer to read it and should be removed before deploying the file live to decrease file size in order to increase site load speed and decrease bandwidth cost. All of these non-essential spaces and comments are known as `syntactic sugar` and must be removed before going live, hence the existence of `style.css` to contain a version that is stripped down to a single huge line of code optimized for a browser's rendering engine but virtually unreadable to a human. 

JS Beautifier is an online utility to format a file. It can unminify a minified JS/CSS/XHTML file but note that you shouldn't ever be moving from minified to unminified but rather the reverse. This tool is best to provide proper indenting, spacing and overall formatting to "beautify" your development version so it is readable and in the proper syntax:

    http://jsbeautifier.org/

One you are ready to minify/compress then online tools exist for this as well:

    http://refresh-sf.com/yui/ 

All development should take place in `style.uncompressed.css`, even though this file will affect nothing on the live site, because this is the only file that is readable by a human eye. Once a change is made the contents of `style.uncompressed.css` should either be run through a build script to minify it automatically or it should be run through any common code minification tool available via text editor plugin or via an online minification tool. Both files will contain exactly the same CSS functionality if done correctly, the only difference being the removal of all unnecessary spaces, comments, etc.

If you want to see the difference in speed that the difference can make you may want to put up an uncompressed file, benchmark site speed, then put up the compressed version and repeat.

**Inspector Tools**

Since toying with the CSS didn't help though, I would approach this by using a browser's inspector tool. For example, in later versions of Chrome there is a set of "developer tools" available from the main menu:

    Chrome Main Menu > View > Developer > Developer Tools

The inspection tool is represented by a magnifying glass icon, as is the case in most other browser inspection tools, such as the Firebug plugin for Firefox (link below). Clicking the mag glass icon starts the tool, allowing you to click any page element to see the element's generated html source, which can be notably different from the unrendered html that you would see via a browser's `view source` option. 

Firebug for FireFox:

    http://getfirebug.com/

Also displayed in the inspector tool are all the CSS rules being applied to the element being inspected as well as the location of the CSS file/line applying the rule. Your bullet issue would likely be CSS related as you surmised, but I see bullets currently in Chrome on Mac OS X so I am not sure if you have already fixed this issue. 

**Future Proofing**

On another side note, when I inspected the `<ul>` elements on the home page I am seeing many browser specific prefixes to support CSS definitions that have not been formalized and included in the official releases of CSS standards currently. However, on the elements using prefixes I am not seeing any future proofing in place. "Future proofing" is a way to make sure the code will not break in time with the release of new browsers that may drop support for the prefixes, a likely scenario once the experimental CSS definitions are standardized. Right now on unordered lists on the home page I am seeing properties like `-webkit-margin-end` to provide support for the WebKit rendering engine currently used by Chrome and Safari, as well as `-moz-margin-end` to provide support for Firefox and its Gecko engine. However, I see no subsequent definition for `margin-end` without the prefix. If it can reasonably be assumed that a CSS feature will become standard, a definition such as `margin-end` with no prefix should be specified in addition to the prefixed definitions to future proof the code, so that if prefixes are not supported in future browsers the rule will still be applied if `margin-end` has by that point become standard.

You will want to again use the inspector tool described above. Inspect the elements with the JS in place and the inspector tool will give you all CSS rules being applied to the element, even if it is being set at runtime with a JS file. Apply the necessary CSS definitions to your new non-JS elements.

Let's say that the inspector tool shows that my elements in question are standard links with a class of `navLink` contained within an HTML5 nav element:


    <nav>    
        <a href="./my/File/Path/Relative/to/Root.html" class="navLink">Link</a>
    </nav>


The links have some CSS style for normal and hovered states, but it is being set via JavaScript on DOM ready:


    $(function(){
    	$('nav .navLink')
    		.css({
    			'background':'#000',
    			'color':'#FFF',
    			'display':'block',
    			'height':'50px',
    			'width':'100px'
			})
    		.hover(function(){
    			$(this)
    				.css({
    					'background':'#FFF',
    					'color':'#000'
    				});
    			});
            })
        ;
    });

If I killed that JS then my example nav links wouldn't show up as styled block elements, instead they would be normal text links. Using the inspector tool on the links with the JS still applying the style will show you all of the properties being applied so you don't have to track down the JS file unnecessarily. Since the inspector reflects what properties are being applied, you can then convert it over to plain CSS declarations for normal and hovered states:


    /* Normal */     
    nav a.navLink {
    	background: #000;
    	color: #FFF;
    	display: block;
    	height: 50px;
    	width: 100px
    }

    /* Hovered */    
    nav a.navLink:hover {
    	background: #FFF;
    	color: #000
    }

**CSS Specificity**

At that point the JS is no longer needed and the affected JS lines should either be removed or, if possible, the entire script call can be removed from the DOM tree to improve browser performance. Note that to maintain best practices in my CSS above I have carried the selectors out to one level of specificity by including `nav` to indicate where target elements are contained, thereby avoiding conflicts with any other instances of a class of `navLink` that may lie outside of the `<nav>` element.At least one level of specificity is considered best practice and I also defined my selector as `a.navLink` rather than `.navLink` to indicate that the properties should only be applied to `<a>` elements of class `navLink` rather than any element with that class.

Although it may seem cumbersome, these are considered best practices for a huge number of reasons. Most notably, at least one level of specificity helps to avoid naming conflicts that become quite likely with multiple developers and a large code base. By being this specific I'm making sure that I wouldn't be accidentally overwriting any other elements that may have this class but with a different intended set of definitions. Secondly, browser performance is improved through specificity, both in JavaScript and CSS, as it more accurately describes an element's location. Rather than wasting resource overhead by browsing the entire DOM tree for instances of class `navLink`, here the browser's CSS rendering engine is being told it only has to look within the `<nav>` element rather than through the entire document, providing speed benefits. 

I worked on a site for a while that averaged about 4 million unique visitors a day, so with so many visitors we went for even more speed improvement any way we could get it. That included alphabetizing the CSS properties, as in my example above, because when a browser renders the document it alphabetizes all CSS property definitions as part of the process. By alphabetizing definitions ahead of time we squeezed out extra performance by saving the browser this additional task, so you can get as crazy as you want to if you are trying to optimize your code =)
