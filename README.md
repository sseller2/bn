#BN Plan#

===========================

Repo for files associated with the BN transfer. Temporarily public until system files are in version control at which time it will be switched to private and will require a GitHub account and permissions approval in order to view my repository.

I am currently writing up the plan for exporting most of the current brick-anew.com site out of the X-Cart framework and setting up in a new Magento installation. Magento is a proprietary adaptation of the Zend web app platform, just like X-Cart is a proprietary branch of OSCommerce/OSCMax. Although both are PHP based, the development and build process for Magento is going to be a good bit different from X-Cart and its use of Smarty as a templating layer.
